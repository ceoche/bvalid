 * <p>
 * Mark a method as business rule validation in an object annotated with {@link BusinessObject}. Such business rule
 * method must be a boolean expression assertion. By convention if the result is 'true', it means the business rule is
 * correct/valid, and false otherwise.
 * <p>
 * A method marked with this annotation must be public, take no parameters and return a boolean value.

 * example:
 * <pre>
 * {@code @BusinessObject(name="my-entity")
 * public class MyEntity {
 *
 *    public String name;

 *    {@literal @}BusinessRule(description = "name must be defined.")
